# Place the script in the working directory 
# Execute the below command to load the functions

## Test Step 1

source("cachematrix.R")

## Test Step 2

# Create a matrix by invoking makeCacheMatrix

a <- makeCacheMatrix( matrix(c(1,2,3,4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2) );

## Test Step 3

# Display the Matrix

a$getMatrix()

# Displays below result

# > a$getMatrix()

## Test Step 4

# Get the inverse by invoking cacheSolve

cacheSolve(a)

# Displays below result
# Cache is not present and is building and returning it

# > cacheSolve(a)

# Cache not present and I am building it

## Test Step 5

# Get the inverse by invoking cacheSolve for second time

cacheSolve(a)
